# mobile_price_prediction
This deals with the mobile price prediction using the properties of the Mobile. 
The idea generated when I started to use the Shopping apps where the filter category used to categorize the things based on the search.
When it comes to the filtering the things in general life we will sort the things easily but as we need to train the machine it should be accurate to the output need to be genrated.
The machine definitely needs a right approach with the best solution.
